### Package title

### Install from CRAN

```

### Vignettes
[The Tidyverse Manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html)  
[Welcome to the Tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/paper.html)  

### Application
The primary website for the package can be found here
[Tidyverse Website](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)  
There are plenty of online examples for the applications of the package (which is essentially a collection of packages). This book is one example of a pretty comprehensive reference:  
[R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)  
Additionally, there are plenty of "cheat sheets" for [plotting](https://statsandr.com/blog/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) and [data wrangling](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf), and much more that can be found with a google search! 
### Review
The tidyverse package is actually a collection of a variety of useful, harmonious packages and is meant to simplify the installation and use those packages. According to their website, the tidyverse is “an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.” The tidyverse package and associated methodologies essentially streamline data manipulation and visualization in a way that I find more intuitive and useful as an ecologist (who is also definitely not a coding guru).
